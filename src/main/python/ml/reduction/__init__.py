This package will contain the noise reduction (dimension reduction) tools.
    
On the rise:
    Analysis on manifolds:
        ISOMAP, LocallyLinearEmbedding, and LaplacianEigenmaps
    Non‚ÄênegativeMatrixFactorization

Old but reliable:
    PCA in its different versions (standard PCA, robust PCA, sparse PCA,kernel PCA,...) simple, good for linear models.

Still good for specific models:
    Factor Analysis and MultidimensionalScaling

Why?
